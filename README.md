Project Title: Student Performance Tracking System Documentation with MongoDB and GitHub

Description:
The Student Performance Tracking System is designed to effectively monitor and analyze the academic performance of students within educational institutions. This project utilizes MongoDB as the database management system and GitHub for version control and documentation. The project tasks are documented step-by-step using GitHub, including the creation of the database, collections, data import, CRUD operations, query optimization, aggregation functions, and more.

Project Tasks Documentation:

Create the Database: Use mongosh to create the database. Take a screenshot and include it in the documentation.

Create Collections: Use mongosh to create the necessary collections. Take screenshots and document the process.

Insert Documents: Use insertOne() and insertMany() commands to add documents to the collections. Take screenshots and document each step.

Import Data from Excel: Create an Excel file with fields matching the collections and import data using mongoimport command. Specify fields and data types. Show the process and screenshots.

Populate Collections: Populate all collections with at least 10 documents each. Document the process with screenshots.

Update Documents: Use updateOne() and updateMany() commands to update documents. Document each operation with screenshots.

Read Documents: Use findOne() and find() commands to read documents. Document the process with screenshots.

Delete Documents: Use deleteOne() and deleteMany() commands to delete documents. Document each operation with screenshots.

Identify Workloads: Create workload.xlsx file with a list of common queries. Identify workloads based on the tutorial provided. Document the process and include the file.

Check Execution Stats: Use mongosh to check execution stats for each query. Take screenshots and document the results.

Create Indexes: Based on the workload Excel file, create indexes to optimize query performance. Document the process and include screenshots.

Check Execution Stats Again: After creating indexes, check execution stats for each query again. Document the results with screenshots.

Aggregation Functions: Demonstrate the implementation of at least 7 different MongoDB aggregation functions. Document each function and include examples.

Aggregation Pipelines: Show at least 3 different aggregation pipelines using MongoDB. Each pipeline should consist of at least 3 different functions. Document each pipeline and include examples.

GitHub Documentation:

Create a GitHub repository for the project.
Document each task in the repository's README.md file using markdown syntax.
Commit changes for each step and provide clear commit messages.
Use branches for each feature or task and merge them into the main branch upon completion.
Encourage collaboration by allowing team members to review and contribute to the document
